        <b>Your job</b><br/>
        You are shown statements - one that is known to be correct and one which you have to rate - in the general area of movies, each statement consists of two entities (usually persons or movie titles) and their connection (usually job titles). Also make sure you read and understand the examples below. We will also consider the time you took for each submission, so you should try to avoid distractions and do the whole questionnaire in a single go, but you don't have to worry about your working speed.<br/>
        <br/>
        You should ignore grammatical or spelling mistakes in the statements and only rate content of the entities and their connection, also be aware of the direction of the connection as this is substantial to the meaning. It doesn't matter if the statement is just one part of multiple correct answers, just rate the two statements shown and nothing else. You will have to follow the provided links or use your preferred web search to get more information about the meaning of some entities as only their name is shown, but most entities appear in multiple statements. The rating you give a statement should depend on exactly how close to the correct answer the statement to rate is, not just whether it is correct or not. Statements are only considered completely correct if they match the correct statement, not if they are different but still correct as stated by the links or search results.<br/>
        <br/>
        You should also answer whether you think the statement you are rating is a mistake made by a human, a mistake made artificially or a completely correct statement. Use your best human judgement for this answer and explain the reason in short.<br/>
        <br/>
        The code can be built by using the provided numbers (eg. x-y-z) and writing the x-th letter of the first entity, the y-th letter of the connection and the z-th letter of the second entity of the statement that you have to grade (not the correct one). Small and capital letters can't be interchanged for this and spaces need to be counted as well and replaced with "_" if you have to write them in the code. The numbers will always stay below 6, so you don't have to worry about counting too much. In the example below the respective letters for the code are written <b><i>bold and italic</i></b>, make sure you understand this process before answering as this (while not the only one) is a required criteria for acceptance.<br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Example A</b><br/>
        Numbers: 1-4-5<br/>
        Correct:<br/>
        <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Avatar_(2009_film)" target="_blank">Avatar (2009 film)</a> &#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500; <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/director" target="_blank"> director</a> &#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x27A4; <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/James_Cameron" target="_blank">James Cameron</a><br/>
        To rate:<br/>
        <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Avatar_(2009_film)" target="_blank"><b><i>A</i></b>vatar (2009 film)</a> &#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500; <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/director" target="_blank"> dir<b><i>e</i></b>ctor</a> &#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x27A4;  <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/James_Cameron" target="_blank">Jame<b><i>s</i></b> Cameron</a><br/>
        <br/>
        Code: Aes<br/>
        <br/>
        This example would be considered completely correct and rated with a rating of 5. Note that it doesn't matter if there are also other directors besides him or if he also had other relations to this movie. This statements can be understand as "The movie Avatar has the director James Cameron".<br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Example B</b><br/>
        Numbers: 3-1-2<br/>
        Correct:<br/>
        <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Titanic_(1997_film)" target="_blank">Titanic (1997 film)</a> &#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500; <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/producer" target="_blank">producer</a> &#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x27A4; <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/James_Cameron" target="_blank">James Cameron</a><br/>
        To rate:<br/>
        <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Titanic_(1997_film)" target="_blank">Ti<b><i>t</i></b>anic (1997 film)</a> &#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500; <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/producer" target="_blank"><b><i>m</i></b>usicComposer</a> &#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x27A4; <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/James_Cameron" target="_blank">J<b><i>a</i></b>mes Cameron</a><br/>
        <br/>
        Code: tma<br/>
        <br/>
        This example would be considered partially wrong because James Cameron was not the music composer of the movie. Your rating should reflect how similar the job of producer is to the job of music composer.
