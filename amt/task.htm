                    in what format the questions are presented as well as to get you familiar with the verification of
                    restrictions.

                <p><strong>Rules</strong> :</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Existential restrictions indicate that there must be a property of the specified type. Other
                        types are not restricted.<br/>
                        Keywords in textual models: <strong>some</strong> ; <strong>at least one</strong> <br/>

                                                                        style="max-width: 50%;">
                        <br/> <br/>

                        <ul>
                            <li>For example : "PetLoverTypeB has, amongst other things, some Cat pets." - Every instance
                                of PetLoverTypeB has a Cat pet and may also have other pets.
                            </li>
                            <br/>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Universal restrictions indicate that all property values for the specified property must be of a
                        certain type. All values must be of the type but a property value does not have to exist.<br/>
                        Keywords in textual models: <strong>only</strong> ; <strong> no other than </strong> <br/>

                                                                        style="max-width: 50%">
                        <ul>
                            <li>For example: "PetLoverTypeA has, amongst other things, only Dog pets." - If instances of
                                PetLoverTypeA have pets, the pets are always dogs. Instances of PetLoverTypeA, however,
                                may not have any pets.
                            </li>

                </ul>

                <p><strong>Tips</strong>:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The universal restriction does not imply the existential restriction.</li>
                    <li>If some information is not included in the model, the missing information is not false unless it
                        contradicts the model.
                    </li>

    Please make sure you are familiar with the rules and examples provided in the <b>Instructions</b> before answering
    the question.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>-->

    <short-instructions>
        <b>Your job</b><br/>
        You are shown some statements in the general area of movies (containing two entities and their connection) that you need to grade. You should ignore grammatical mistakes in the statements and only grade the entities and their connection. It doesn't matter if the statement is just one of multiple correct answers, just grade the statement you see. You will have to follow the provided links or use your preferred web search to get more information about the meaning of some entities as only their name is shown, but most entities appear in multiple statements. The rating you give a statement should depend on how close to the correct answer (which you might have to find yourself) the statement is, not just whether it is correct or not.<br/>
        <br/>
        The code can be built by using the provided numbers (eg. x-y-z) and writing the x-th letter of the first entity, the y-th letter of the connection and the z-th letter of the second entity, small and capital letters can't be interchanged for this and spaces need to be counted as well and replaced with "_" in the code. This is not the only criteria for acceptance but a required one.<br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Example A</b><br/>
        Numbers 3-7-13<br/>
        <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Avatar_(2009_film)">Avatar (2009 film)</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/director"> director</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/James_Cameron">James Cameron</a><br/>
        <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/James_Cameron">James Cameron</a> is <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/director">director</a> of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Avatar_(2009_film)">Avatar (2009 film)</a><br/>
        <br/>
        Code: ao_<br/>
        <br/>
        This example would be considered completely correct and rated with a rating of 5. Note that it wouldn't matter if there ware also other directors besides him or if he also had other relations to this movie.<br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Example B</b><br/>
        Numbers 9-3-1<br/>
        <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Titanic_(1997_film)">Titanic (1997 film)</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/producer">producer</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/James_Cameron">James Cameron</a><br/>
        <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/James_Cameron">James Cameron</a> is <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/producer">producer</a> of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Titanic_(1997_film)">Titanic (1997 film)</a><br/>
        <br/>
        Code: (oT<br/>
        <br/>
        This example would be considered partially wrong because James Cameron was not the producer of the movie but arguably had similar jobs. Your rating should reflect how similar his job was to the job of producer.
