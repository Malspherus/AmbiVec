        <b>Your job</b><br/>
        You are shown statements - one that is known to be correct and one which you have to rate - in the general area of movies, each statement consists of two entities (usually persons or movie titles) and their connection (usually job titles). Also make sure you read and understand the examples below. You should ignore grammatical mistakes in the statements and only rate content of the entities and their connection, also be aware of the direction of the connection as this is substantial to the meaning. It doesn't matter if the statement is just one part of multiple correct answers, just rate the two statements shown and nothing else. You will have to follow the provided links or use your preferred web search to get more information about the meaning of some entities as only their name is shown, but most entities appear in multiple statements. The rating you give a statement should depend on exactly how close to the correct answer the statement to rate is, not just whether it is correct or not. If you know the statement to rate is actually correct but not equal to the shown correct statement you should still rate the distance and not treat it as correct.<br/>
        <br/>
        You should also answer whether you think the statement you are rating is a mistake made by a human, a mistake made artificially or a completely correct statement. Use your best human judgement for this answer and explain the reason in short.<br/>
        <br/>
        The code can be built by using the provided numbers (eg. x-y-z) and writing the x-th letter of the first entity, the y-th letter of the connection and the z-th letter of the second entity of the statement that you have to grade (not the correct one). Small and capital letters can't be interchanged for this and spaces need to be counted as well and replaced with "_" if you have to write them in the code. The numbers will always stay below 6, so you don't have to worry about counting too much. In the example below the respective letters for the code are written <b><i>bold and italic</i></b>, make sure you understand this process before answering as this (while not the only one) is a required criteria for acceptance.<br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Example A</b><br/>
        Numbers: 1-4-5<br/>
        Correct:<br/>

        <br/>
        This example would be considered completely correct and rated with a rating of 5. Note that it doesn't matter if there are also other directors besides him or if he also had other relations to this movie. This statements can be understand as "The movie Avatar has the director James Cameron".<br/>
        <br/>

        This example would be considered partially wrong because James Cameron was not the music composer of the movie. Your rating should reflect how similar the job of producer is to the job of music composer.

                <ul>
                    <li>Existential restrictions indicate that there must be a property of the specified type. Other
                        types are not restricted.<br/>
                        Keywords in textual models: <strong>some</strong> ; <strong>at least one</strong> <br/>

                        <ul>
                            <li>For example : "PetLoverTypeB has, amongst other things, some Cat pets." - Every instance
                                of PetLoverTypeB has a Cat pet and may also have other pets.
                            </li>
                            <br/>

                    </li>
                    <li>Universal restrictions indicate that all property values for the specified property must be of a
                        certain type. All values must be of the type but a property value does not have to exist.<br/>
                        Keywords in textual models: <strong>only</strong> ; <strong> no other than </strong> <br/>

                        <ul>
                            <li>For example: "PetLoverTypeA has, amongst other things, only Dog pets." - If instances of
                                PetLoverTypeA have pets, the pets are always dogs. Instances of PetLoverTypeA, however,
                                may not have any pets.

                <ul>
                    <li>The universal restriction does not imply the existential restriction.</li>
                    <li>If some information is not included in the model, the missing information is not false unless it
                        contradicts the model.
